Hi there, I’m Maryam Talebzadeh 👋

🌟 About Me

🔭 I’m currently working on front‑end projects, data analysis tasks, and small AI experiments.

🌱 I’m deepening my knowledge of React, Next.js, Robotics frameworks, and advanced data analytics tools including Power BI, Pandas, and SQL.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open‑source front‑end projects, data-driven applications, and Python AI libraries.

💼 I’m also passionate about project management, optimizing workflows, and delivering high-impact solutions.

💬 Ask me about JavaScript, Python, data analysis, Power BI, project management, or anything Web.

⚡ Fun fact: I can spend hours tweaking a single line of code for the perfect animation — or exploring a dataset until I find a hidden insight.
