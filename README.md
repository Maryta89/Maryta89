🌟 About Me

🔭 I’m currently working on front‑end projects and small AI experiments.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open‑source front‑end tools and Python AI libraries.

💬 Ask me about JavaScript, Python, Git, or anything Web.

⚡ Fun fact: I can spend hours tweaking a single line of code for the perfect animation.
